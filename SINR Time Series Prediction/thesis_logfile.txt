working in lstm:
	v_min = 5 and v_max = 20;
	time steps = 1000;
	user_sinr_10_oct has std dev = 1 for log norm shadowing
	rnn expects 3 dims

Date : 11 Nov 2021
	Ran 5000 simulations for SINR without shadowing.
	the shape of sinr file : print(np.shape(sinr_all)) = (5000, 21, 105) #5users per sector
	for 1 user sinr_no_shad_1user.csv -> shape = 5000
	expand the dimension to (5000, 1) -> each sinr value is a vector

	function window_dataset() creates a tensorflow dataset
	I create one for training and one for validation
	training_set , validation_set resp.
	Shape of this dataset is : (32, 10, 1)
	i.e., (batch_size, window_size, 1)  here 1 => sinr value at each time step
